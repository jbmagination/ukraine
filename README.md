# Resources List
This area is meant to provide a unified list for resources to support Ukraine amidst Russian aggression.

## Context
On the 24th at February, at 5AM (UTC+2), the armed forces of the Russian federation attacked Ukraine.

## Donations
You can directly support the Ukrainian army by donating:
- [Donate through the National Bank of Ukraine](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi)
- [Donate through the Return Alive Foundation (charity)](https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/)

## Precautions
**DO NOT GIVE INFORMATION AS TO WHERE THE UKRAINIAN ARMY, OR ANY SOLDIER, IS LOCATED.** It could cost the soldier their lives, as Russian propaganda spreads through social media. It is highly likely if not guaranteed Russia is monitoring these sources.
